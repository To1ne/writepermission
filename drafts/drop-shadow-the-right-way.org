Everybody loves drop shadow. It allows designers to give their creations
some depth. That's why it is used so often. But when shadows are used,
it is important you use drop shadow correct. So the shadow should look
physical real. This is not an easy task and even the greatest designers
fail to do it right.

Maps]]. It is a great and fast tool to locate an address or plan a
route. But you might have expected this, they fail at correct drop
shadows.

Do you think there is something wrong with it? The drop shadows
maybe...?
