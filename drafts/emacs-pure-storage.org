** Pure What?

I'm always running emacs built from source. I get the sources from the
[[http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/][Official Bazaar repository]].
There are clean instructions on
[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BzrForEmacsCasualDevs][EmacsWiki]] on
how to use them.

But last week, when I started my fresh build for the first time, the
=*splash*= buffer showed the message:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

#+END_EXAMPLE
