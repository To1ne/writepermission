Just wanted to draw a history on the mobile phones I've used in my life.

** Nokia 3310 (end 2000 till 2001)

Yes, I bought one of the 126 million Nokia 3310 phones sold (which makes
it one of the best sold ever). In the early days of the release of the
phone Nokia couldn't keep up the production with the request. But I
managed to get one of the first.

It was my first mobile device, in my eyes it was awesome. Maybe the most
awesome about the phone was
"[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_%28video_game%29#Snake_on_Nokia_phones][Snake
II]]".

I don't know where this phone is now, I think I donated to family or a
friend when I bought my second phone.

** Nokia 5510 (2001 till 2004)

I spend almost all my savings on this phone (I remember it costed about
15000 BEF, which is approximately 375 EUR). And this phone just had it
all: - A complete QWERTY keyboard - A music player with 64 MB storage

If I think of it, it is ugly as hell and it's also huge to carry in your
pocket. But I thought it was great. I loved typing on the complete
keyboard.

I still have this phone and still works.

** Nokia 6820 (2004 till 2006)

Best phone I've had so far. Really look at it, the design is clever. You
get a phone with complete keyboard without any other downside. You might
think the mechanism is quite fragile, but it is rock solid.

I've installed quite some applications on this phone, because in those
days Symbian/Java apps were hot, so there was a good selection
available.

This phone died on me. The repair would cost about 150 EUR, which was
too much for me back then, so I never got it fixed. I still regret it.

** Siemens CF62 (a few months in 2006)

Now a time of /mobile phone identity crisis/ started. As a student I
didn't have much money to buy a fancy phone so I got this cast-off from
my brother.

This was really a horrible device. Slow, lots of bugs, bad battery life,
... Never used a Siemens since then.

** Motorola Razr V3 (a few months in 2006)

This phone was hot in those days. With lots of advertising it should
start the Motorola empire in Europa. But it didn't. Sure the design was
nice, but I didn't like using it. Probably that is why it also was I
cast-off of my brother. Although it had that catchy 'Hello Moto'
ringtone.

I still have this phone, but don't know if it is working.

** Nokia 1600 (end 2006 till 2007)

A dead simple phone, and cheap. That is the reason I bought it. As you
can read from this post, I was satisfied from Nokia, so I went back to
it. The best thing about it, it was cheap (again). So I didn't have to
take real care of it. If it fell on the floor, no problem...

This phone is still in my drawer and I use it once in a while when I
need a phone that doesn't require gentle handling.

** Nokia E71 (2007 till present)

Again I saved some money and bought me a decent phone. I looks like a
Blackberry, but still is a Nokia (my favorite brand so far). It does
what it should, without any extra. So I cannot conclude this phone is
great.

I think what I hate most about it is the bad camera. This is a common
weakness of Nokia phones (especially the business types).

I'm not planning to buy a new phone, but if I will I don't know what I
will buy: ### Nokia I doubt it. Nokia just can't keep up with the
competition. The touch is quite unresponsive (compared to other brands)
and the selection of apps is poor. Although there is one change: If they
make a new version of the 6820, I really would consider buying it. ###
Android Some colleagues of my are really satisfied with there Android
phones. And I like the /openness/ of Android. But I've heard better not
to buy a Samsung, because they add a lot of junk to the Android OS. ###
iPhone Well, you know, iPhone. Do I need to say more?

** Conclusion

I think it is clear from this post, I really like a mobile device with a
complete keyboard. So they might influence the choice of my next phone.

One thing I think is funny. When I bought the Nokia 5510 people laughed
at me because I bought such a huge device. But nowadays most people want
the complete keyboard. So he who laughs last, ...

P.S.: I think I need to do some more research on the dates, but there
about right (I guess).
