I've been meaning to write this post for a long time. But now it's
finally here.

Meanwhile I've been using the Truly Ergonomic computer keyboard (short
/TECK/) for about 4 months now. Let me go over the features.

** Key placement

At Truly Ergonomic, they call it [[http://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/index.php?route=product/category&path=20_26][Columnar Key placement]]. Basically,
this means the keys are placed in non-staggered columns. In theory,
your fingers have to travel less far to reach keys that are not on the
home row.

In other reviews I've read this key placement has a steep learning
curve, but I did not expect this layout would be a big issue.

I was wrong...

The first week I did type lots of errors. I really had to learn to
touch type over again (my colleagues laughed at me). But I took
advantage of this, because before I nearly ever used my pinkies while
touch typing. So while learning to type on the TECK I tuned my touch
typing skills. Now I type fast on the TECK, even faster than before
and with less errors.

Only so far I didn't get used to the position of the number keys. It
feels like they are farther away than on a regular keyboard. But this
just might a feeling because I often use the keypad or remove my hand
from the home row when typing numbers on a regular keyboard.

** Split halfs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: split-halfs
   :ID:       fa276141-22fe-4d80-8e75-4b77fdd75531
   :END:

This is one of the main reasons why I bought the TECK. To get a more
ergonomic keyboard.

And, it helps.... It doesn't look like the angle between the two halfs
is large, but I think it is good enough to have ergonomic benefit.

** Mechanical keys

   :END:

My TECK is equiped with the Cherry MX Brown switches. And I love them.
They are really comfortable to type on. They do not require much force
and really give a tactile response, without being too /clicky/. After
using mechanical keys for some time, you really hate typing on those
cheap /rubber dome/ keyboards.

*** Missing & double keypresses
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: missing-double-keypresses
    :ID:       fc64d445-41dd-488e-9938-9ae8f288518e
    :END:

But when it comes to the Truly Ergonomic keyboard, these mechanical
keys have a downside. They can suffer from [[http://elitekeyboards.com/support.php?lang=en#5][/contact bouncing/]].  This
means in some cases a key press is not registered or registered
double.

In the first two months I had many keys suffering from this issue. I can
tell you, this really frustrating! So much that if the thing did not
cost a few hundred dollar, I think at some point I would have thrown it
through the window.

After a the first week I was really sure there was something wrong
with the keyboard, so I contacted Truly Ergonomic. Also I did browse
the web to find people with the same problem and all I could find was
1 topic on [[http://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=25055.0][geekhack]]. Some people reported the problem did disappear
after some time. So I decided to keep using it, hoping the problem
would dissappear. Meanwhile days passed by.  Some days /all/ keys were
working good, other days the TECK was a b*tch to work with. After two
weeks without response from Truly Ergonomic I decided to send another
email. This time with a bit more pressure, while still being polite.

Another two weeks later, still no response. In that time, the problem
was almost gone. But I still wanted response from them, so I mailed
again. This time I was not that polite. I did explain I like the
keyboard layout and the mechanical keys, but double/missing keypresses
were just unacceptable for a keyboard in this price range. I really
did put them under pressure by demanding a return and refund, without
me paying the shipping costs. Surprisingly, putting them under
pressure worked. A few days later I did receive a response.

Basically, they told me, a /break-in/ of mechanical keyboard keys is
not uncommon. Which in mean time did figure out myself. And, of
course, they pointed me to the Terms & Conditions telling me the
shipping costs would be at my expense. Eventually they also published
the issue on their [[http://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/index.php?route=product/category&path=79_83#Keyswitch][Troubleshooting page]].

After 4 months of every day use, I wish I could say all problems are
gone. But still very rarely the Left Space is missing keypresses. And
when it does, the problem persist for a while (an hour or so).

I am still mailing the manufacturer about this issue.

** Compactness
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: compactness

   :END:

The keyboard is really compact. And that is awesome.

** Symmetric layout
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: symmetric-layout
   :ID:       841c5730-664a-4bbf-919a-7c78354fb39b
   :END:

All modifier keys are placed symmetrically. So the ~Ctrl~, ~Alt~ &
~Shift~ are placed on the same position on both sides. This makes it
really easy to use your opposite hand to press a modifier keys,
e.g. ~Right Ctrl + C~, ~Left Shift + U~ This has a large ergonomic
advantage. You never have to reach for keys when having your pinky
placed on a modifier key.

** Tab, Backspace & ENTER
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: tab-backspace-enter
   :ID:       8c3faf7a-f948-4817-b2db-79d7be7783c8
   :END:

It took me some time to learn their location, but you'll get used to
it.  Too bad the ~Backspace~ is placed right above the ~ENTER~,
because you can accidentally press ~ENTER~, while you wanted to erase
text. Which can be a /problem/ inside a chat window.

** Shift & Ctrl
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: shift-ctrl
   :ID:       cadab82d-c560-412c-ba04-8a2e747f0f56
   :END:

I do not really like the default placement of all keys. By default the
~Shift~ is located at the home row and ~Ctrl~ below it. I've tried
this for a short time, but I did not like it for two reasons:

- On a regular keyboard Shift is placed below the home row.
- On a regular keyboard I did remap ~Ctrl~ to ~Caps Lock~ (above ~Shift~)

So for me it makes more sense to swap ~Ctrl~ & ~Shift~. Luckely for
me, Truly Ergonomic provides a [[http://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/index.php?route=product/category&path=79_90#Ctrl_Shift][firmware version]] with these to keys
swapped. Also the keycaps are easily swapped, because their shape is
the same.

** Alt
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: alt
   :ID:       d24e5a2f-088e-4ef2-bf50-893a72e09625
   :END:

The position of the ~Alt~ is something I was afraid for. The default
location is all the way at the bottom corners. For an emacs user this
is a disaster. So people [[https://twitter.com/xah_lee/status/308865952584458240][suggested]] me to remap the left ~Space~ to
~Alt~. This places Alt at a similar location as on a regular
keyboard. Unfortunately this means ~Alt~ is only on the left side of the
keyboard and ~Space~ is only at the right side of the keyboard

In the beginning it was hard to type ~Space~ with the right hand
(only). Until now I still use this placement.

But I am thinking about remapping the middle ~Delete~ key to ~Alt~
(maybe more on that in a next post).

To change the keymapping, I used [[http://www.tucows.com/preview/327616][KeyTweak]] on Windows.

** Mac
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: mac
   :ID:       00c9c8fb-f79d-4267-9e85-e5f5812b4165
   :END:

I work on 3 different operating systems: Mac (at home), Windows and
Linux (at work). I'm already used to switching, and I like the ~Ctrl~
on the same location for all systems. Because of that, when working
with the TECK on Mac I do not set [[http://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/index.php?route=product/category&path=79_80#DIP][toggle DIP switch #2]]. But this means
the ~SuperKey~, at the center of the keyboard, is the only ~⌘~
key. This key is located between the ~5~ and ~6~. And this does not
feel right.

So I've used [[https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/][KeyRemap4MacBook]] to remap the left ~Space~ to ~⌘~. Again
this gives a very similar feel as regular keyboard. Because I use the
~⌘~ as [[https://github.com/To1ne/temacco/blob/master/core/temacco-mac-osx.el#L7][Meta key in Emacs]], this makes switching systems even easier.

** Overall

   :END:

I like the TECK, a lot. I've been looking on the internet for lot of
other keyboards. And in my opinion the TECK is the best on the market
(in its price range). Too bad I've had trouble with missing/double
keypresses.

** Advice

Do I recommend the TECK? Actually, I do!

The layout is really great, also is the quality of the mechanical keys.
The only big downside, Truly Ergonomic sucks at support. And to be
honest, this also might be a showstopper for me. On the other hand, I am
also considering to buy a second one for use at home.

*** Alternative
    :PROPERTIES:

So far I did not test many keyboards. But if I had to recommend one
keyboard different from the TECK, it would be the [[http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/freestyle2_pc.htm][Kinesis Freestyle 2]].
With the two separate halfs you can use place them similar to the
TECK, which is a big ergonomic improvement. Also the keys are good,
although not as good at the TECK. You can buy it at [[http://www.backshop.nl/nl_NL/producten/toetsenborden/ergonomische-toetsenborden/freestyle-solo-toetsenbord-2][backshop.nl]].

One other keyboard which has gained a lot of my interest lately is the
[[http://ergodox.org/][ErgoDox]]. Soon it will be available on [[https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox][Massdrop]] (you need to register
first).

I wrote this post on my Apple keyboard, and now my left pinky hurts.
