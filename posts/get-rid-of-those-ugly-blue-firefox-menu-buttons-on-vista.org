I am a Vista user, I'm not very proud of it but can't afford a Mac at
the moment, and use Firefox as my favorite browser. Works like it
should, but I have one problem with it. The menu buttons are in a real
ugly blue, see it for yourself:

I not really in to using themes for your browser, because most of the
time they just slow down your system. But for one time I wanted to
make an exception.

I've actually found a Firefox addon to solve this problem.  [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7119][XP on
Vista]]. If you can't install it, try to install [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/7119][another version]]. So
after install and reboot your menu buttons look like this:

If you like the blueish Vista like buttons you can try the [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6839][Vista on XP]]
addon.
