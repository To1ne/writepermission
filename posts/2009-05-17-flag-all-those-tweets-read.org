** Problem

   :END:

Every time I switched between Twitter client (client at work, client at
home, client on mobile phone) I lost track of which tweets I've read.
Although it's not required to read all tweets (see
[[http://www.twitterisntemail.com/][Twitter isn't email]]), but I like
to do it. I've been thinking for a solution to this problem and I think
I've found one.

** Solution

   :END:

I've created a new Twitter account [@fattr](http://twitter.com/fattr).
*fattr* is an acronym for "*F*lag *A*ll *T*hose *T*weets *R*ead". The
idea was: Send a direct message to @fattr to flag all current Tweets
read. So all tweets received *after* sending the DM are *new*.

** Realization

   :CUSTOM_ID: realization
   :END:

Using the [[http://classes.verkoyen.eu/twitter/][PHP Twitter]] library
of [[http://blog.verkoyen.eu/][Tijs Verkoyen]] @fattr will follow you
back within 10 minutes. This is required to send DMs. The same library
will make it possible to log in at [[http://fattr.tonotdo.com][website]]
to read new tweets.

** Future work

I really need to improve the code of the project and work on the page
design. And I would like to promote use of this
[@fattr](http://twitter.com/fattr) idea to Twitter client authors. So on
every client you would be able to read new tweets, even if they are
tagged by another client/location.
