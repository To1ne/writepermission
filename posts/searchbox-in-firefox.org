One of the hot topics of the last years is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability][usability]]. Consistency can
help improving the usability, but I think Firefox 3 fails in
consistency when you use the searchbar on three different operation
systems: Linux, Windows and Mac OSX.

** Example 1: Windows

On Windows shows the searchbar like this:

I really like this layout. You can argue about the position of the
buttons: "Next" on the right seems to make more sense, while "Next" on
the left will make it easier to push it.

** Example 2: Linux

Next image shows how the searchbar looks on Linux (OpenSUSE 11 with
KDE3 in my case).

This layout is quite good. The icons are really clear what the buttons
do and the position of the buttons makes sense.

** Example 3: Mac OSX

   :END:

On Mac OSX 10.5 the seachbar looks like this:

In my opinion, this layout stinks. The position of the buttons is
incorrect, because the button shape makes the "Previous" button look
like "Next" and vice versa.

I know there are limit on these different OS's about what you can do
with the default UI elements (for example on Mac OSX). But I think the
people at Mozilla should try harder to make the user clear what the
buttons do and at least change which the position of the two buttons.
