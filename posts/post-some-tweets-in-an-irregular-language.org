** Problem
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: problem
   :END:

Most people use one main language (e.g. English) to post there tweets.
But sometimes you really want to post a tweet in a different language.
If you just post the tweet in that "irregular" language, most of your
followers would not understand the tweet. So you don't want to bother
those people with those tweets. Some people use a second Twitter
account to post in another language, but this isn't very convenient
because you'll have to which between accounts.

** Solution

Recently Twitter has changed behavior of [[http://blog.twitter.com/2009/05/small-settings-update.html][@reply system]]. This change
caused that tweets starting with an @username you don't follow, would
not appear in your timeline. A lot of people (including me) really
didn't agree with this change, and protested using the [[http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23fixreplies][#fixreplies]]
hashtag.

But maybe this #fixreplies problem can solve the language problem. If
for every used language a user would exist, users can post a tweet in a
irregular language starting with this username. If your friends follow
this user too, which means they understand that language too, they will
see this tweet, otherwise they don't.

** Language Users

As test I've created the [[http://twitter.com/lang_nl][=@lang_nl=]] user, use this one if you want to
tweet in Dutch (Nederlands). If you need another language, feel free
to create one. But try to use the same name convention, meaning:
=@lang_<language_code>=, with =<language_code>= the code taken from
[[http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php][ISO 639-2 Language Code List]], and leave a comment which user you've
created.
