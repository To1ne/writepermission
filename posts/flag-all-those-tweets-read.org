Every time I switched between Twitter client (client at work, client
at home, client on mobile phone) I lost track of which tweets I've
read. Although it's not required to read all tweets (see [[http://www.twitterisntemail.com/][Twitter
isn't email]]), but I like to do it. I've been thinking for a solution
to this problem and I think I've found one.

I've created a new Twitter account [[http://twitter.com/fattr][@fattr]]. *fattr* is an acronym for
"*F*lag *A*ll *T*hose *T*weets *R*ead". The idea was: Send a direct
message to @fattr to flag all current Tweets read. So all tweets
received *after* sending the DM are *new*.

Using the [[http://classes.verkoyen.eu/twitter/][PHP Twitter]] library of [[http://blog.verkoyen.eu/][Tijs Verkoyen]] @fattr will follow you
back within 10 minutes. This is required to send DMs. The same library
will make it possible to log in at [[http://fattr.tonotdo.com][website]] to read new tweets.

I really need to improve the code of the project and work on the page
design. And I would like to promote use of this [[http://twitter.com/fattr][@fattr]] idea to Twitter
client authors. So on every client you would be able to read new
tweets, even if they are tagged by another client/location.
