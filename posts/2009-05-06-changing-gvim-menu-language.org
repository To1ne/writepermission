I wanted to try gVim (Vim on Windows with a GUI) on my Vista machine. So
I've downloaded the [[http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc][installer]]
from the [[http://www.vim.org/][website]] and ran it. Everything OK so
far. But when I started it, it seems the menu's are in Dutch. I *really*
hate that, because I use all software in English (and the Dutch
translations in gVim, as in many other apps, really suck). But it took
me some time to find out how to change it. But I've found a way.

** Solution
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: solution
   :END:

Add the following lines at the top of the file
=%PROGRAM_FILES%/Vim/_vimrc=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    lang en
    language mes en
    set langmenu=en_US.UTF-8
#+END_EXAMPLE

That's it, just restart and everything should be in English.

To modify the window size, add:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    winsize 200 50
#+END_EXAMPLE

Enjoy your Vimming...
