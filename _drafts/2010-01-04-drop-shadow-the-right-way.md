title: Please fix those drop shadows
---

## Introduction
Everybody loves drop shadow. It allows designers to give their
creations some depth. That's why it is used so often. But when shadows
are used, it is important you use drop shadow correct. So the shadow
should look physical real.
This is not an easy task and even the greatest designers fail to do it right.

## Google Maps
The main reason for this article is [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com).
It is a great and fast tool to locate an address or plan a route. But
you might have expected this, they fail at correct drop shadows.

### Example
Let's start with an example. This is a screenshot showing my home town
on Google Maps.

Do you think there is something wrong with it? The drop shadows maybe...?
