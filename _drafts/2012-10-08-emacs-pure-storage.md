title: Emacs Pure Storage

## Pure What?
I'm always running emacs built from source. I get the sources from the [Official Bazaar repository](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/).
There are clean instructions on [EmacsWiki](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BzrForEmacsCasualDevs) on how to use them.

But last week, when I started my fresh build for the first time, the `*splash*` buffer showed the message:

    http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Pure-Storage.html
