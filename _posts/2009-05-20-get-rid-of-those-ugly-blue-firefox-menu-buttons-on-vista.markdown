<h3>Problem</h3>
I am a Vista user, I'm not very proud of it but can't afford a Mac at the moment, and use Firefox as my favorite browser. Works like it should, but I have one problem with it. The menu buttons are in a real ugly blue, see it for yourself:
<img src="http://blog.writepermission.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/firefox-menu-on-vista.png" alt="firefox-menu-on-vista" title="firefox-menu-on-vista" width="167" height="75" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120" />

<h3>Solution</h3>
I not really in to using themes for your browser, because most of the time they just slow down your system. But for one time I wanted to make an exception.

I've actually found a Firefox addon to solve this problem. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7119">XP on Vista</a>. If you can't install it, try to install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/7119">another version</a>.
So after install and reboot your menu buttons look like this:
<img src="http://blog.writepermission.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/firefox-menu-on-xp.png" alt="firefox-menu-on-xp" title="firefox-menu-on-xp" width="167" height="75" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-121" />

<h3>Additional</h3>
If you like the blueish Vista like buttons you can try the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6839">Vista on XP</a> addon.
