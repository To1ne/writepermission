## Problem
I am a Vista user, I'm not very proud of it but can't afford a Mac at the moment, and use Firefox as my favorite browser. Works like it should, but I have one problem with it. The menu buttons are in a real ugly blue, see it for yourself:

## Solution
I not really in to using themes for your browser, because most of the time they just slow down your system. But for one time I wanted to make an exception.

I've actually found a Firefox addon to solve this problem. [XP on Vista](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7119). If you can't install it, try to install [another version](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/7119).
So after install and reboot your menu buttons look like this:

## Additional
If you like the blueish Vista like buttons you can try the [Vista on XP](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6839) addon.
