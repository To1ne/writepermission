## Introduction
Drop shadow is a nice way to give your <del datetime="2009-09-23T19:39:07+00:00">web</del>design some depth. So modern designs integrate it. But when you use drop shadow you should do it right, meaning it should look physical real. That is not always easy and even the biggest designers fail to do get it right.

## Drop shadow on Google Maps
The reason why I write this article is [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com). It is a great fast tool to locate an address or plan a route. But you might have thought this, they fail doing correct drop shadows. See this example:

Look at the drop shadows, this is physically impossible. You see the map in top view and also the text balloon is viewed in top view.

To illustrate this situation I've made a little drawing:
[caption id="attachment_284" align="alignnone" width="359" caption="GoogleMaps drop shadow"]<img src="http://blog.writepermission.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/dropshadow-nowwith.png" alt="GoogleMaps drop shadow" title="dropshadow-nowwith" width="359" height="170" class="size-full wp-image-284" />[/caption]
This illustrator includes the drop shadow and you see the drop shadow is similar to the text balloon.

But if the text balloon is perpendicular to the map, the drop shadow looks like Google Maps shows it:
[caption id="attachment_284" align="alignnone" width="359" caption="GoogleMaps drop shadow"]<img src="http://blog.writepermission.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/dropshadow-nowwith.png" alt="GoogleMaps drop shadow" title="dropshadow-nowwith" width="359" height="170" class="size-full wp-image-284" />[/caption]
This situation is problematic because this is hard to represent in 2D.
