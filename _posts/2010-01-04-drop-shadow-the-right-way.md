## Introduction
Everybody loves drop shadow. It allows designers to give their
creations some depth. That's why it is used so often. But when shadows
are used, it is important you use drop shadow correct. So the shadow
should look physical real.
This is not an easy task and even the biggest designers fail to do it right.

## Google Maps
The main reason for this article is [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com).
It is a great and fast tool to locate an address or plan a route. But
you might have expected this, they fail at correct drop shadows.

### Example
Loot at the following example.

Do you think there is something wrong with it? I think there is...

### Explanation
TODO rework after this
Here is a little illustration to display the this situation I've made a little drawing:

This illustrator includes the drop shadow and you see the drop shadow is similar to the text balloon.

But if the text balloon is perpendicular to the map, the drop shadow looks like Google Maps shows it:

This situation is problematic because this is hard to represent in 2D.
