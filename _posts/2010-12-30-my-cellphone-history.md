## Nokia 3310 (2001 till )
Yes, I bought one of the 126 million Nokia 3310 phones. In the early
days of the release of the phone Nokia couldn't keep up the production
with the request. But I managed to get one of the first.

It was my first mobile device, in my eyes it was awesome. Maybe the
most awesome about the phone was
"[Snake 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_%28video_game%29#Snake_on_Nokia_phones)".

I don't know where this phone is now, I think I donated to family or a
friend when I bought my second phone.

## Nokia 5510 ( till )
I spend almost all my savings on this phone (I remember it costed about
15000 BEF, which is approx. 375 EUR). And this phone just had it all:
- A complete QWERTY keyboard
- A music player with 64 MB storage
If I think of it, it is ugly as hell and it's also huge to carry in
you pocket. But I thought it was great.

I still have that phone and it still works.

## Nokia 6820 ( till )
Best phone I've had so far. Really you should look at it, the design
is really clever. You get a phone with complete keyboard without any
other downside. You might think the mechanism is quite fragile, but it
is rock solid.

I've installed quite some applications on this phone, because in those days
Symbian/Java apps where hot so there was a good selection available.

This phone died on me. The repair would cost about 150 EUR, which was
too much for me back then, so I never got it fixed. But I still regret
that

## Siemens CF62
Now a time of 'mobile phone identity crisis' started. As a student I didn't
have much money to buy a fancy phone so I got a cast-off from my
brother a 'Siemens CF62'.

This was really a horrible device. Slow, lots of bugs, bad battery
life, ...
Never used a Siemens since then.

## Motorola Razr V3
This phone was hot in those days. With lots of advertising it
should start the Motorola empire in Europa. But it didn't.
Sure the design was nice, but I didn't like using it. Probably
that is why it also was I cast-off of my brother.

I still have this phone, but don't know if it is working.

## Nokia 1600
A dead simple phone, and cheap. That is the reason I bought it. As you
can read from this post, I was satisfied from Nokia, so I went back to
it.
The best thing about it, it was cheap (again). So I didn't have to
take real care of it. If it fell on the floor, no problem...

This phone is still in my drawer and I use it once in a while when I
need a phone that doesn't require gentle handling.

## Nokia E71 ( till present)
I saved some money and bought me a decent phone. I looks like a
Blackberry, but still is a Nokia (my favorite brand so far). I does
what it should, without any extra. So I cannot conclude this phone is
great.
I think what I have most about it is the bad camera. This is a
weakness in Nokia phones (especially the business types).


## Next one
I'm nothing planning to buy a new phone, but if I will I still don't
know what I will buy:
### Nokia
I doubt it. Nokia just can't keep up with the competition. The touch
is quite unresponsive (compared to other brands).
Although there is one change. If they make a new version of the 6820,
I really would consider buying it.
### Android
Some colleagues of my are really satisfied from there Android
phones. And I like the "openness" of Android. But I've heard better
not to buy a Samsung, because they add a lot of junk to the software.
### iPhone
Well, you know iPhone. Do I need to say more?

## Conclusion
I think it is clear from this post, I really like a mobile device with
a complete keyboard. So they might influence the choice of my next phone.
