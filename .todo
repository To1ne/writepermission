- "read more" link

- CSS for DISQUS

- Add a footer:
	*Content: ??

- post separator:
	* <hr> done
	* other idea's: dasher, date on left side
	
- short links:
	* .htaccess

NOT:
- use new HTML5 tags
	-> not supported by all browsers and no decent fixs available
	
- some kind of border on the left side
	-> bad idea, does not look nice
